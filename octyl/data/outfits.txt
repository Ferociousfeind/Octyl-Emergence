	description "This is one of the more recent developments by the Octyl, now inundated with energy. While it is frighteningly power-hungry- especially for a species that was on the brink of starvation- their powerful solar panels coupled with their clever battery technology should be able to hold several of these powered simultaneously."

	description "The Grapple Beam is an experimental new technology utilizing the now-inundating abundance of energy the Octyl have found themselves immersed with. By packing a tight beam with as much power as possible, it can briefly and very violently magnetize the hull of its target, pulling itself and the target closer together."

	description "Octyl technology is strikingly efficient, and this geothermal tower, while massive, is much more efficient than the next step down, which is itself twice as efficient as the step after it. This comes at a cost, as this tower is five-and-a-half times larger than the next step down."

	description "This is a pair of ten-ton metal towers that dig into a pocket of water, saturate it with salts, and transform it into one giant battery. It's not as efficient as a totally artificial battery, but it's very resourceful. Disregarding the prerequisite for a liquid body, it's frighteningly efficient."
