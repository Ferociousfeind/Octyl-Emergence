			`A short time after you land, you receive a long-range transmission from the Coalition, of all places. Trying to hide your look of incredulity, you make your way back to your ship to read it.`
			`	Once back to your ship, you look into the transmission. It is addressed to you directly, and a request for your presence on the <destination>. The way it is worded suggests extreme importance.`

			`You are escorted to a private docking bay on <planet> by a few Heliarch warships, and are greeted by a trifecta of the Heliarch as you disembark your vessel. A Saryd, a Kimek, and an Arachi, wearing golden Heliarch circlets.`
			`	"A great service," the Saryd starts, "we require of you. The first human in Coalition space, you are, and our most recent alien encounter, you have become."`
			`	"Like family, the three races of the coalition have become," explains the Kimek. "Forgotten how to negotiate well, we have, and comfortable with our friendship we have grown."`
			`	"Foreign arrivals, there are," the Arachi explains with a hint of urgency, "what to do with them, we know not. Help us, will you?"
			choice
				`	"Yes, I can help you with alien invaders."`
					goto agree
				`	"Maybe, but I have a few questions."`
					goto questioning
				`	"Not now, I am done with aliens."`
			`	"Understood, you are," says the Saryd.`
			`	"Will struggle on our own, the Coalition will," says the Kimek.`
			`	"Please reconsider some time, will you?" finishes the Arach.`

			label agree
			`	"Our thanks, we owe you," says the Saryd, "for such a great service, you will be providing us."`
			`	"If you will," requests the Kimek, "follow our escort fleet to the system of interest."`
			`	"The foreign visitors, we will speak to then," declares the Arachi.`
			goto end

			label questioning
			`	"Answered here, your questions may be," reassures the Saryd, "Ask away, you may."`
			choice
				`	"How long have the aliens been in your space?"`
					goto "how long"
				`	"Have the aliens attacked you yet?"`
					goto attacking
				`	"No, just show me where they are."
					goto end

			label "how long"
			`	"For not very long, the visitors have been among us," answers the Saryd, "As soon as they arrived, we contacted you."
			choice
				`	"Have the aliens attacked you yet?"`
					goto attacking2
				`	"That's all I need to know, thank you."`
					goto end

			label attacking
			`	"Not for very long, they have been here," answers the Saryd, "As soon as they appeared, you we contacted."`

			label attacking2
			`	"The Coalition, the have not yet attacked," explains the Kimek, "A dangerous move at any moment, they could make, we understand."
			`	"How strong they are, we do not know," the Arachi admits solemnly, "With force rivaling the Quarg, they might be able to attack. We do not know. Which is why you, to help us, we ask."`
			`	After a moment of silence, the Saryd asks, "To ask us, do you have anything else, human <last>?"`

			choice
				`	"What if they attack, and you can't defend yourselves?"`
				`	"No, that is all, thank you. Do you know anything else of importance?"
					goto end
			`	The three look between each other, before the Arachi answers, "Run, we will, and your help we will ask for."`
			`	After a longer and more tense silence, the Saryd explained, "Uncertain, we are. Emotional and afraid, we are."`
			`	"What to do, we know not," adds the Kimek, "How this will play out, we must wait to see."`
			`	"If the visitors are friendly, we have barely considered," says the Arachi.`
			choice
				`	"This sounds like my kind of job. Do you have more details?"`
				`	"This sounds risky to me, what else do you know?"`
			label end
			`	"In a vessel like a planet, the alien visitors have arrived. Anything, they have not done yet." explains the Saryd, before instructing, "Fly with us to the visitors, we need you to, and meet with them."
			`	"If they are aggressive and do not want to negotiate," adds the Kimek, "we attack and push them out. If they do not respond to hails, we will explore their giant ship in search of them."`
			`	"If to assist us you wish not, leave you may." says the Arachi, "But if to assist us you wish, meet the Heliarch again in the spaceport."`

			`You spend some time idling near the docking bays of the Ring of Friendship, waiting for Heliarch agents to instruct you further. While waiting, you notice the activity on the ring world had picked up considerably. Double, perhaps triple the activity you're used to seeing.`
			`	On top of the increased activity, the atmosphere seems more tense than usual. Groups of Heliarch agents rushing to and from ships, tending to the ringworld, preparing their warships. Wide-eyed, you watch a large group of Heliarchs ferry shipments of Quarg equipment, and install them onto veteran-looking Punishers.`
			`	After watching the seventh Skylance being installed, a triplet of the Heliarch approach you. "Captain <last>, you are?" asks the Saryd, "Weapons, you hold? Assistance, we may need."`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I have weapons."`
				`	"No, I am here to talk to the aliens."`
					goto diplomacy
				`	"Are those Quarg Skylances?"
					goto skylance
			`	"Fantastic. Precautions, we take. Devastating foes, the Quarg were. A repeat, we the Heliarch do not want," says the Kimek.`
			`	"Aggressive, we are being," notes the Arachi, "but losses we will not take. If friendly they are, attack we will not."`
			goto prepare

			label diplomacy
			`	"Fantastic. If diplomacy we need, provide your services will you?" asks the Kimek. It seems excited, "Devastating foes, the Quarg were. A repeat, we the Heliarch do not want."`
			`	"Aggressive, we are being," notes the Arachi, "but losses we will not take. If friendly they are, attack we will not."`
			goto prepare

			label skylance
			`	"Know Quarg technology, do you?" asks the Kimek. It seems excited, "Have a store of Quarg weapons, do you? Devastating foes, the Quarg were. A repeat, we the Heliarch do not want."`
			`	"Appreciated, assistance would be," admits the Arachi, "Aggressive, we are being, but losses we will not take. If friendly they are, attack we will not."`

			label prepare
			`	"Prepare, you must," advises the Saryd, "Time, we suspect we do not have."`
			`	"A fight, we foresee," adds the Kimek with a tinge of fear and apprehension in its voice.`
			`	The three turn away, and help install an eighth and final Skylance onto a Heliarch Interdictor. Once their work is done, you are allowed to see their handiwork.`
			choice
				`	"It's a masterpiece, I'm sure they'll do well."`
				`	"It's not the best, but it will have to do."`
				`	"Do your ships have enough energy to power so many Quarg Skylances?"`
					goto logistics
			`	"Well, they must do," says a passing Saryd, "or trouble the Heliarch will find itself in."`
			`	"Not pretty, they are," says a Kimek, "But work they must do. Not always pretty, war is."`
			label logistics
			`	"So much power, the Quarg Skylances use," pipes in an Arachi, "Batteries, we must rely on. Enough power, our reactors cannot provide. But in bursts, if we fire, just as strong the weapons remain."`
			`	"Please," says a Saryd, "To the visitors, follow us if you wish."
